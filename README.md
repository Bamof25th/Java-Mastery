ArrayList vs LinkedList

Both ArrayList and LinkedList are implementations of the List interface in Java, but they have different underlying data structures and performance characteristics.

1. Underlying Data Structure
	•	ArrayList: Uses a dynamic array to store elements.
	•	LinkedList: Uses a doubly linked list, where each node contains a reference to the next and previous node.

2. Performance Differences

Feature	ArrayList	LinkedList
Access (get, set)	O(1) (direct index access)	O(n) (traverses the list)
Insertion (add)	O(1) (at the end, amortized)  O(n) (in the middle)	O(1) (at the beginning or middle if node reference is known)
Deletion (remove)	O(n) (requires shifting elements)	O(1) (if reference to the node is known)  O(n) (if searching for the node)
Memory Usage	Less (stores only data)	More (stores data + two references per node)

3. Use Cases
	•	Use ArrayList when:
	•	You need fast access to elements (get() operations).
	•	The size of the list changes infrequently.
	•	Insertions and deletions happen mostly at the end.
	•	Use LinkedList when:
	•	You need fast insertions/deletions in the middle.
	•	The list frequently grows and shrinks.
	•	You don’t need random access often.

4. Example Usage in Java

import java.util.*;

public class ListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();

        // Adding elements
        arrayList.add(1);
        linkedList.add(1);

        // Accessing elements
        int a = arrayList.get(0); // Fast (O(1))
        int b = linkedList.get(0); // Slow (O(n))

        // Removing elements
        arrayList.remove(0); // Slow (O(n))
        linkedList.remove(0); // Fast (O(1) if head)
    }
}

Summary
	•	ArrayList is better for frequent reads and occasional writes.
	•	LinkedList is better for frequent insertions and deletions.
